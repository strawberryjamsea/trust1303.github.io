I'm Jun. I'm 26 in Korea. I'm studying for the degree of Computer Science.

I got my military service done already. I'm now taking a course of Prof.Kwon.

I'm sure that this is going to be a good chance for me to improve my skills at dealing with

sort of stuff like this someday.

Have fun buddies.
